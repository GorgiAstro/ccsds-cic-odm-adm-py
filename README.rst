CIC
===

The CIC format (Centre d'Ing√©nierie Concourante) is an adaptation of the CCSDS format used by CNES. In addition to orbit and attitude data, it allows to exchange mission data such as satellite geometry, thermal data, electrical data, etc.

This format is used in particular by the Timeloop VTS visualization tool developed by Spacebel and CNES.

The reference manual for the CIC format is not distributed publicly but is provided with the VTS software which can be freely downloaded at https://timeloop.fr/vts/. In the VTS root folder, the manual is located at `Docs/Manual/CIC-Exchange-Protocol-V2.0.pdf`.
